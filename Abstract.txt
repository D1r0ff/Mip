Recommendation systems have become an incredibly important part of our lives. They are used in all online services, and the frequency of their use is only growing every year. 

These algorithms are used to personalise the experience by making suggestions tailored to our preferences and interests. The use of such systems is beneficial for both the platform and the end user. It recommends products that the user is more likely to buy, which saves them time and the platform will receive additional profit from new sales.  Without them, our modern online world would be impossible because it is a thing that allows the customer to find the product they need and the seller to increase sales through the target audience.

However, the effectiveness of these systems heavily relies on users' personal information, raising significant legal and ethical concerns. Users often remain unaware of the extent of data collection by platforms, and the risks of data breaches pose a serious threat, potentially exposing personal information within moments.

Moreover, the outcomes of recommendation systems are not always predictable. Users can find themselves trapped in "information bubbles," where they are only exposed to content that reinforces their existing beliefs and preferences. This phenomenon can lead to negative consequences that have already happened many times in human history. 

In this article, we will look at the problems of recommendation systems and the situations they have led to. We will also explore the methods of dealing with these problems that are used now and will be used in the future.
