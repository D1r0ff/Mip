Recommendation systems have become an incredibly important part of our lives. They are used in all online services, and the frequency of their use is only growing every year. 

These algorithms are used to personalise the experience by making suggestions tailored to our preferences and interests. The use of such systems is beneficial for both the platform and the end user. It recommends products that the user is more likely to buy, which saves them time and the platform will receive additional profit from new sales.  Without them, our modern online world would be impossible because it is a thing that allows the customer to find the product they need and the seller to increase sales through the target audience.

But these systems cannot be effective without users' personal information. This causes a lot of problems, both legal and moral. On the one hand, the user is not fully aware of how much of their personal information the platform receives, and on the other hand, databases are often hacked and your personal information can become public in a matter of seconds.

Also, the results of these systems are not always predictable. Sometimes, using recommendation systems can lead you into an “information bubble” from which you cannot get out without help. This can lead to terrible consequences that have already happened many times in human history. 

In this article, we will look at the problems of recommendation systems and the situations they have led to. We will also explore the methods of dealing with these problems that are used now and will be used in the future.
